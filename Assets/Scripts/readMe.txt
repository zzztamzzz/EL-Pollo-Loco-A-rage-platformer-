In this read-me file I will briefly describe the game that group five has created.

The game is called El Pollo Loco and the goal is to navigate to the end of the level in each stage.

As you attempt to move on to the next level, by reaching the stage clearing door, there will be.
several obstacles that will try to steal your lives.

The starting number of lives is three per stage. Powerup can be located throughout the stages that provide.
additional lives as well as speed increases and invincibility frames.

If you successfully complete a stage, you will begin the next with the number of lives when clearing the previous stage.

If all lives are lost before completing the stage, the level will reset with the main charecter having three lives.

Controls are described in the how to play section of the menu scene.

Thanks to Thomas Coffey and Muhammad Hasaba for their work on sprite creation. This allowed us to refrain from using outside assets when possible. 

Tamzid Choudhury did a lot of work/scripting pertaining to movement. 

Thomas Coffey created a lot of the animations used, as well as preformed a large amount of work to the animator.

I designed many of the levels, and worked on all the UI interfaces. Such as the main menu, pause menu which is accessible via the escape key. 
I also did work on powerupâ€™s and the player health system.

Level Prefabs, patrolling objects were created by Thomas Coffey and the level swapping mechanism was created by myself.
The game plays well, and we stuck true to our idea of creating a rage inducing 2D platformer, following a chicken theme. 

There are some very precise jumps throughout the levels and all levels have been cleared prior to being added to the game.

As a final note, a bug has been spotted pertaining to the UI and lives. Occasionally, the game will freeze and need to be restarted when the player loses all lives, and the current level should have been restarted.

To address this, we have made modifications to the lives / reset system moving the operation to reset the level and reset the health UI / Lives to the awake() method. 

The bug seems to appear at random.

I hope you enjoy our game, as we enjoyed creating it.

Thank you for a great semester!

Best,
Dennis Fuentes.
